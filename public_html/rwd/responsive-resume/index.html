  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

    <div>
      <h5> <strong>Giles-Parscale</strong>, San Antonio, TX <em>Web Master, Developer, & Designer</em></h5>
      <!-- <p>I created various designs for NOV Fiber Glass Systems's promotional items that would be used/shown in various countries, cities, and states this includes: folders, USBs, shirts, training kits, and their market brochures. I was in charge of maintaining their branding and re-branding process; as a part of the re-branding I created design guidelines to be followed in-house and one to be given to their distributors. I design their advertisements in various media applications, this includes: magazine/flyers, web banners, digital/print billboards, pop-up banners, and invitations. The company has various products which require multiple literature applications; I would update and re-create older literature along with re-branding them. This includes creating multiple templates for their various amounts of literature to give it all one cohesive style and feel. I would also maintain and create graphics for the companies website through their content management system. I edited their photography along with taking photos of their products to be used in many of their promotional and advertisement designs.</p>

      <h6>Key Experiences</h6>
      <ul>
        <li> In creating the promotional items and advertisements I would use a combination of InDesign for the layout and typography along with Lightroom and Photoshop to edit and clean the photography; I would use Adobe Illustrator in creating and maintaining graphics. For their literature, newsletter, and bulletins I would use InDesign to update and modify the layout during the rebranding process. For the in-house documents, I would create templates with the new branding in MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Publisher for employees that were proficient with MS Office programs.</li>
        <li>I also took photographs using my own equipment on the company's job location for marketing material. Since I maintained the company's website I would update the content and use HTML and CSS for certain sections of the website to maintain its responsive elements.</li>

    <div>
      <h5> <strong>SWIG Inc.</strong>, San Antonio, TX
        <em>Intern <span class="line"></span> Graphic/Web Designer <span class="line"></span> Photographer</em></h5>
      <p>I designed a few banners for their Facebook page and created a web design concept for their companies website SWIG. I also re-coded and uploaded another of their companies site Worm Tequila. I photograph both of the companies locations to be used in their websites or any other company marketing item.</p>

      <h6>Key Experiences</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>My main knowledge and experience I gain was to understand fully that some companies take advantages of their interns. The swig company requested way too much from me and didn’t give enough back in return. They were using interns to create their designs because they didn’t want to pay professionals; they said, “they cost too much”.</li>
        <li>I got to photograph the inside of two different small buildings with different lightings, which helped me enhance some of my photography skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5><strong>University of the Incarnate Word Tutoring Services</strong>, San Antonio, TX <em><span class="line"></span> Data Organizer<span class="line"></span> Web Content Manager <span class="line"></span> Office Assistant</em></h5>
      <p>I primarily entered the data that was collected from all the sessions that had happen through out the semester and created a summary to give to my director who then presented it to her boss. I also managed the website and fix up the content using Wordpress.</p>

      <h6>Key Experiences</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>I learn to adapt quickly to the needs of the center. I figured out how to use Excel very proficiently as well as helping other students during our tutoring sessions.</li>
        <li>I was able to display some of my photography at Tutoring Services as well as my first painting because they really enjoy my work and thought it looked great to represent the center. They also commissioned me to make another painting for the center and I know have two paintings and two photographs displayed in the center.</li>
