    <h3>Qualification Profile</h3>
    
<p>As an artist, I have always pushed myself to surpass my limitations; this has allowed me to acquire various practices in different art fields in order to solve a communication problem using visual art. I am a photographer who has experience in various type of photography like portraiture, commercial, night and documentary. I have a BA in Studio Art with a concentration in Photography. I have had my photography published nationally by Photographer’s Forum Magazine and received a certificate of excellence at Creative Summit XXVI. Like I said I like to solve a communications problem and there’s where my field in Graphic/Web Design comes more into my experiences. I began at S.A.C. and got my Associates then transferred to U.I.W. to get my B.F.A. in Graphic Design. During my U.I.W. years, I was able to better my creative and my problem solving skills, which help my Artwork get to the next level and push my designs to a professional level.</p>

  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    
    <div>
      <h5> <strong>SWIG Inc.</strong>, San Antonio, TX, 20xx-20xx
        <em>Intern | Graphic/Web Designer | Photographer</em></h5>
      <p>I designed a few banners for their Facebook page and created a web design concept for their companies website SWIG. I also re-coded and uploaded another of their companies site Worm Tequila. I photograph both of the companies locations to be used in their websites or any other company marketing item.</p>
      
      <h6>Key Experiences</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>My main knowledge and experience I gain was to understand fully that some companies take advantages of their interns. The swig company requested way too much from me and didn’t give enough back in return. They were using interns to create their designs because they didn’t want to pay professionals; they said, “they cost too much”, so I decided to quit.</li>
        <li>I got to photograph the inside of two different small buildings with different lightings, which helped me enhance some of my photography skills.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h5><strong>University of the Incarnate Word Tutoring Services</strong>, San Antonio, TX, 20xx-20xx | <em>Data Organizer | Web Content Manager | Office Assistant</em></h5>
      <p>I primarily entered the data that was collected from all the sessions that had happen through out the semester and created a summary to give to my director who then presented it to her boss. I also managed the website and fix up the content using Wordpress.</p>
      
      <h6>Key Experiences</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>I learn to adapt quickly to the needs of the center. I figured out how to use Excel very proficiently as well as helping other students during our tutoring sessions.</li>
        <li>I was able to display some of my photography at Tutoring Services as well as my first painting because they really enjoy my work and thought it looked great to represent the center. They also commissioned me to make another painting for the center and I know have two paintings and two photographs displayed in the center.</li>
